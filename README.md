# Challenge 1: Analyzing Similar Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview
After finding funding via a kickstarter campaign for their new play _Fever_, our client became curious about the results of fundraising campaigns for similar projects compared to when they were launched and what their amount goal was.  Fortunately, Kickstarter keeps records for all campaign results and takes the time to organize by project type and sub-type.  Using this data we were asked to determine the success of similar campaigns and provide our analysis and conclusions.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To look at how similar campaigns faired over the course of time we decided to investigate the results of similar campaigns by month.  The graph below is the result of this analysis comparing the total number of different results (Successful, Failed, Canceled) within each month for the period of data collected.

Both the Failed and Successful lines seem to have similar shapes and likewise seem to share many of the same peaks and valleys in their data.  The total number of Canceled shows on the other hand doesn't show nearly as much of a dramatic change, with the exception of their being no canceled shows during the month of October.  The month with the highest number of successful (and failed) appears to be the month of May with that peak extending from about April to August.  In addition there are more subtle peaks for the successful and failed categories in the months of February and October.



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Monetary Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
